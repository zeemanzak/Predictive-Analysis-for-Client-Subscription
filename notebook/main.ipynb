    "##### *Problem Statement*\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to improve the success rate of direct marketing campaigns by identifying factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. This involves understanding client demographics, campaign characteristics, and historical engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Business Objective*\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase Conversion Rates: Identify clients more likely to subscribe to a term deposit to optimize marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Allocation: Minimize unnecessary calls to unlikely prospects, reducing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Insights: Gain a deeper understanding of client profiles and preferences for future campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Key Business Questions*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which client demographics (e.g., age, job, marital status, education) are associated with a higher likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do campaign-related factors (e.g., number of calls, duration of contact) impact conversion?\n",
    "3. What role does previous engagement and its outcome play in current campaign success?\n",
    "4. Can we predict the likelihood of subscription   based on client and campaign data?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Hypothesis Statement*:\n",
    "#### H₀ (Null Hypothesis):\n",
    "Client characteristics (e.g., age, job, marital status, education), financial details, and campaign attributes do not significantly influence the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):\n",
    "Client characteristics, financial details, and campaign attributes significantly influence the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit."
